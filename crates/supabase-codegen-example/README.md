# Schema bindings example

`build.rs` generates bindings from `schema.json` by default. It adds a prelude type alias, a text mapping, `PartialEq`, and a targeted `TypedBuilder` derive. `src/main.rs` includes the output with `include_schema!`.

This example uses codegen and client 0.9 with the owned `rp-postgrest` 3.0 runtime.
Regenerate Rust bindings when upgrading. The generator emits schema-qualified finite field and FK lookups.
The committed format 3 snapshot supports offline builds. Regenerate older snapshots with the standalone codegen CLI.

Run without a database:

```sh
cargo run -p rp-supabase-codegen-example --offline
```

Cargo's offline flag requires cached dependencies. The executable checks omitted identity/default
fields, explicit null, query-first decoding, exact numeric values, and nested relationship shapes.

The executable uses `select!` with a function-local row import instead of a local `Message` DTO.
Typed column markers check filters. Generated payloads check insert and update fields.
`fetch()` infers the selected response type and checks HTTP errors before decoding JSON.

`src/relationship_projections.rs` contains mixed scalar, nested, inner, and predicate-only projections.
Relationship handles check child columns and selected projection ownership.
Compiler consumers cover local and generic selections, renamed runtime paths, identifier hygiene, strict nullable/duplicate keys, wrong edges/children/owners, inner and empty embeds, locked reselection, shared DTO contracts, and paged-read mutation rejection.

`src/gaps.rs` defines one `Artifact` DTO for both generated `skills` and `adapters` relations.
Its permanent live scenario covers typed ordering, borrowed IN values with commas/quotes/backslashes,
JSON text paths, inclusive pagination, server counts, minimal writes, and raw `Vec<Artifact>` decoding.
It also renders `schema::params` pairs without constructing a typed query and feeds them to the
owned builder. An application can pass those unencoded pairs to its own HTTP query serializer.
JSON/JSONB markers implement `JsonColumn`; unrelated columns do not.

Typed RPC `.fetch()` infers the generated return type and returns the canonical owned REST error.
HTTP 204 supports unit-valued void RPCs, not arbitrary empty-body JSON results. Consumer response
tests cover this contract; the live executable calls `echo_message`, not a void function.
The example retains numeric values as arbitrary-precision `serde_json::Number`, without an `f64` conversion.


Run consumer behavior and compiler rejection checks:

```sh
cargo test -p rp-supabase-codegen-example --offline
```

## Live scenario

Apply `smoke.sql` to a disposable PostgreSQL database. It creates message, relationship, `skills`,
`adapters`, and `artifact_links` fixtures, plus deliberately mismatched artifact tables for compiler
contracts. It grants access for verification. Do not apply it to the repository's existing Supabase
database or a production project.

Expose `public` through PostgREST. Set these environment variables:

- `SUPABASE_CODEGEN_DATABASE_URL`, a database connection string used only by `build.rs`. Use verified TLS remotely. Add `sslmode=disable` for a trusted local database.
- `SUPABASE_CODEGEN_API_URL`, the PostgREST base URL. Use `https://PROJECT.supabase.co/rest/v1` for Supabase.
- `SUPABASE_CODEGEN_API_KEY`, optional Supabase API key.
- `SUPABASE_CODEGEN_ACCESS_TOKEN`, optional bearer access token.

Then run `cargo run -p rp-supabase-codegen-example`. Live introspection never falls back to the snapshot after an error.
The executable first checks direct and reverse FK relationships, billing/shipping ambiguity,
PK/UNIQUE reverse to-one shapes, ordered composite FKs, nested filters, and empty-embed existence predicates.
It compares left and inner behavior. Run-specific cleanup removes relationship fixtures after recoverable errors.
Projected insert, update, and delete also run after scoped child filters lock the selection.

`gaps::live` runs next. It inserts run-specific skills and adapters with minimal return, reads the
same shared DTO through both relations, checks exact counts and parameter rendering, and attempts
both cleanup deletes even after a recoverable scenario error. The skill cleanup checks its affected
row count; the adapter cleanup requests minimal return.

It then inserts a projected message, reads it with a typed filter, updates its nullable field,
reads the view, calls the RPC, and deletes the row. It checks numeric precision through typed fetches.

The scenario uses a 30-second timeout. A panic or timeout can leave inserted rows. Use a disposable database.

The fixtures grant access to `PUBLIC` and do not define production RLS policies. The scenario
requires visibility and write access to its inserted rows. It does not prove application RLS
correctness; RLS or permissions can change embed visibility and counts.
Live acceptance ran on Rust 1.85 with PostgreSQL 17 and PostgREST 16.2. Offline decoding and
HTTP-fixture tests are separate checks and are not evidence of a live server run.

Remote DDL does not trigger Cargo change detection. Change the tracked database environment variable, or register your migrations in `build.rs`, to request another introspection. Remove the database variable to return to the committed snapshot.
