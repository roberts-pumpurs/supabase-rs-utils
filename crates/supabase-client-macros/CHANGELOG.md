## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Shared `projection!` declarations accept `filters { key: [column_for_first_relation, column_for_second_relation] }` with compile-time value/filter type equality and exact relation ownership.

## [0.9.3](https://github.com/roberts-pumpurs/supabase-rs-utils/compare/rp-supabase-client-macros-v0.9.2...rp-supabase-client-macros-v0.9.3) - 2026-10-06

### Other

- *(schema)* share column contracts and projection compilation

### Changed

- Compile named projections through hidden support behind the runtime's `$crate`-preserving adapter.
  Named and local records share one strict decoder emitter and one selected-field renderer.

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/roberts-pumpurs/supabase-rs-utils/compare/rp-supabase-client-macros-v0.9.1...rp-supabase-client-macros-v0.9.2) - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Align the version with client 0.9.2. Macro behavior is unchanged.

## [0.9.1](https://github.com/roberts-pumpurs/supabase-rs-utils/compare/rp-supabase-client-macros-v0.9.0...rp-supabase-client-macros-v0.9.1) - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

### Added

- Query-first `select!` expressions and lossless `key!` names for client 0.9.
